Restaurant Menu App Base

This repository contains the foundational codebase for a restaurant menu app, developed using Flutter and Dart. The core feature of this app base is the local shopping cart system, which allows users to add and manage items in their cart during their browsing session. The cart functionality is designed to be non-persistent, meaning that the cart's contents are not stored in memory between app sessions.
